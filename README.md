# Frontend Mentor - Multi-step from solution
This project is a solution to the [Multi-step form challenge from Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ). These challenges offer a hands-on way to build realistic projects and enhance your coding skills.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:


- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made
